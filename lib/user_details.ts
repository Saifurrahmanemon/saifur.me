      'At Earnest Data Analytics, I led frontend development for platforms like Benefitwise, Vistar, and Meribachat, crafting performant and accessible interfaces using React, TypeScript, and Next.js. Beyond frontend work, I contributed to backend development by building microservices in Node.js with PostgreSQL and designing RESTful APIs. A key contribution was developing the Reconciliation Settlement Framework (RSF) and the Issue and Grievance Management (IGM) systems for Vistar, a participant in the ONDC ecosystem. These microservices were essential for managing financial settlements and resolving transactional issues efficiently. RSF enabled automated reconciliation and settlement workflows to ensure data consistency and timely payments, while IGM provided a robust system for tracking and resolving issues and grievances across the network.'
