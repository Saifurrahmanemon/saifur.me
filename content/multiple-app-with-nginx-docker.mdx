  port using Nginx and Docker.'
---

In the realm of web development, there are scenarios where you might need to run
multiple frontend applications simultaneously on the same localhost port. This
situation often arises during development or testing phases. Thankfully, with
the help of Nginx, a powerful web server, this can be achieved seamlessly. Nginx
acts as a reverse proxy, enabling us to manage multiple frontend apps
efficiently.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the setup, ensure that you have the following installed on
your machine:

- Nginx web server
- Docker
- Node

## Steps:

### 1. Project Setup

Organize your project structure:

```
project_folder/
│
├── app1/
│ ├── Dockerfile
│ └── ... (App 1 files)
│
├── app2/
│ ├── Dockerfile
│ └── ... (App 2 files)
│
└── nginx/
└── nginx.conf
```

### 2. Dockerize Frontend Apps

Create Dockerfiles for each app (`app1` and `app2`) to define their containers.

Example Dockerfile for `app1`:

```Dockerfile
# Use a base image suitable for your frontend app (e.g., Node.js)
FROM public.ecr.aws/bitnami/node:16.20.0

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json (if applicable)
COPY package.json package.json

# Copy package-lock.json (if applicable)
COPY package-lock.json package-lock.json

# Install dependencies
RUN npm i

# Copy the rest of the app files
COPY . .

# Build the app
RUN npm run build

# Expose the port
EXPOSE 3052

# Set the command to start the app
CMD ["npm" ,"start"]

```

### 3. Configure Nginx

Create an `nginx.conf` file inside the `nginx` directory to configure Nginx as a
reverse proxy to route traffic to app.

Example `nginx.conf`:

```nginx

server {
    listen       80;
    listen  [::]:80;
    server_name  localhost;

    #access_log  /var/log/nginx/host.access.log  main;


    location /app1 {
       proxy_pass http://app1:3000; # Change the port to match your app's port
    }
    location /app2 {
         proxy_pass http://app2:4000; # Change the port to match your app's port
    }

    #error_page  404              /404.html;

    # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html

    error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
    }

}

```

### 4. Docker Compose Configuration

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory of your project to
define and manage the services for Nginx and the frontend apps.

Example `docker-compose.yml`:

```Dockerfile

version: '3'

services:
  app1:
    build: ./app1
    container_name: app1
    ports:
      - "3000"

  app2:
    build: ./app2
    container_name: app2
    ports:
      - "4000"

  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: nginx
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
      - app1
      - app2

```

### 5. Run the Applications

Navigate to your project folder in the terminal and execute the following
command to start the containers:

```docker
sudo docker compose up
```

### 6. Access Apps

You can access your frontend applications via the specified paths:

- Application 1: http://localhost/app1
- Application 2: http://localhost/app2

Voila! You've now successfully configured Docker Compose with Nginx to run
multiple frontend applications on the same localhost port, allowing you to
manage and test various applications conveniently during development.
